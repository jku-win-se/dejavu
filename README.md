# DejaVu - TLE Scenario Visualizer




Our tool, DejaVu, infers and further visualizes change  scenarios that have been applied to a given class in source code,  across multiple versions ofa software system.  DejaVu additionally augments the change information with prior commits from GitHub repositories, as well as associated issues from Jira issue  tracking  system.


The DejaVu Visualzier (*tle.dejavu.eclipse*) is an Eclipse Plug-in for visualizing scenarios generated with TLE (Trace Link Evolver).

Please see the [installation instructions](install.md) for furhter details on how to install and run DejaVu.
We provide [study material](studymaterial/README.md) used in our controlled experiment
